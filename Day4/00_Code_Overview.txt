"A class is a blueprint for objects. A class does not occupy memory until an object is created.
An object is an instance (i.e., an example) of a class."

ðŸ“˜ P8. Create a class Movie with name, rating, and releaseYear. Create 5 movie objects and display

ðŸ“˜ P10. Create a class Laptop with brand, RAM, and price. Add a constructor to initialize values and a 
method to display them.

   class Example 
   {
     Example() // default constructor
      { 
      System.out.println("Default Constructor Called");
      }
    }


    class Example {
    int x;
    Example(int a) { // parameterized constructor
        x = a;
    }
    }

    class Example {
    int x;

    Example(int a) {
        x = a;
    }

    // Copy Constructor
    Example(Example e) {
        x = e.x;
    }
    }
