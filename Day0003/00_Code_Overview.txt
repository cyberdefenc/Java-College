P18. WAP to check a number is perfect or not
     
     Pefect number means sum of its Proper factors excluding this number is laways equals to this number

     Example: 28
     Let's find the divisors of 28 (excluding 28):
     Divisors: 1, 2, 4, 7, 14
     Sum: 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28
     ‚úîÔ∏è So, 28 is a perfect number.
