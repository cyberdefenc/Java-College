     Static members are shared across all instances (class-level), while non-static members are unique to each object (instance-level),        allowing different states.

     user and print all one by one with [i]
P5.  Instialize an empty array but with size and inputs from user and print
     all one by onewith [i] and Arrays class is also used here
P6.  Sum of All 1D arr Elements
P7.  Find Maximum Element and minimum Elements
P8.  Find second Maximum Element and minimum Elements
     max2 = Integer.MIN_VALUE;    -2,147,483,648
     min2 = Integer.MAX_VALUE;     2,147,483,648
P9.  Find third Maximum Element and minimum Elements
     int max1 = Integer.MIN_VALUE, max2 = Integer.MIN_VALUE, max3 = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
     int min1 = Integer.MAX_VALUE, min2 = Integer.MAX_VALUE, min3 = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
