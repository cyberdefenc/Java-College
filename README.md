In our college Java training is on progress.
I have made Folder inside my JAVA-COLLEGE repository,like Day1,Day2 etc,for better understaning of our training vision.
Inside every folder there is a text file included for all the programs we have performed that particular day,you can directly access
particular program with just its name
